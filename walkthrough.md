# Walkthrough: New Website Implementation

I have successfully implemented the new website structure and verified it locally.

## 1. Implementation Details
*   **Structure**: Created `index.html`, `research.html`, `teaching.html`, and `cv.html`.
*   **Styling**: Implemented a clean, responsive design in `css/style.css` using the Inter font and a professional color palette.
*   **Content**: Migrated content from the existing Google Site analysis.

## 2. Verification Results
I used the Browser Agent to navigate through the local development server (`http://localhost:8000`).

### Home Page
*   **Status**: ✅ Verified
*   **Content**: Name, Affiliation, Contact Info displayed correctly.
