                        Indian Lower Judiciary</a>
                    <span class="pub-meta">Accepted, Journal of Development Economics</span>
                    <div class="pub-abstract">
                        Historically, the debate on judicial independence has been centered on whether the participation
                        of external branches in the appointment process of judges hampers the impartial administration
                        of justice. However, less attention has been given to how the internal judicial organization
                        shapes the judge's decision. This paper, which focuses on the Indian lower judiciary, explores
                        whether the prospects of promotion to higher courts result in currying favor with judicial
                        leaders who possess discretionary power over personnel matters within the judicial organization.

                        Broad representation and competent leaders are both important factors when selecting
                        representatives in a democracy. While gender quotas aim for the equal representation of genders,
                        it is a challenge for non-elite women to become politicians in the context of elite dominance.
                        This study explores the random assignment of gender quotas across villages in India to examine
                        the impact of gender quotas on the broadness of representation and the competence of candidates.

                        To examine whether the effectiveness of punishment options varies with community network
                        structures, we targeted 10 Japanese fishing communities and conducted public goods games.
                        Estimation results find that the punishment option is counterproductive in the closed
                        communities because it crowds out existing cooperative norms.

                        We explore the random assignment of gender quotas across villages in India to investigate
                        whether women members of local councils affect public good allocation in their constituencies.
                        We find that the performance of women council members is generally the same as men members in
                        public good allocation, except for a lower performance by women in delivering water facilities.
