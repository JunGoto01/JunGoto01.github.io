                        <div class="pub-abstract">
                            Historically, the debate on judicial independence has been centered on whether the
                            participation of external branches in the appointment process of judges hampers the
                            impartial administration of justice. However, less attention has been given to how the
                            internal judicial organization shapes the judge's decision. This paper, which focuses on the
                            Indian lower judiciary, explores whether the prospects of promotion to higher courts result
                            in currying favor with judicial leaders who possess discretionary power over personnel
                            matters within the judicial organization. For this purpose, I exploit natural experiments:
                            female judicial leader's appointments replacing male incumbents, causing the unpredictable
                            shift of gender preferences in personnel evaluation of local judges. Then, I use the triple
                            difference strategy exploiting the high-court level variation on whether it has at least one
                            female judicial leader, the individual judge level variation on the eligibility as the high
                            court judge, and the temporal variation pre- and post-female judicial leader's appointment.
                            Estimation results show that eligible judges pander to female leaders and hand down lenient
                            sentences on female parties. Evidence suggests that discretionary appointments of judges
                            through the non-transparent "judges-selecting-judges" system can be detrimental to the
                            independent administration of justice. Therefore, careful institutional design is necessary
                            to balance judicial accountability and independence.

                        corruption among bureaucrats and politicians, there has been little discussion on how to
                        prevent the bribe-giving behavior of ordinary citizens. This paper investigates the role of
                        social media information in influencing the supply of bribes by citizens instead of the
                        demand side. We therefore developed and published an original news application in India and
                        implemented a three-month experiment. In this application, we randomly circulate live news
                        related to corruption to users and incorporate a lab experiment into the app system to
                        elicit users' bribery behavior every week. We find that corruption news involving
                        politicians within a close geographical proximity lowers users' moral costs against the
                        anti-social bribery act, leading to an increase in the amount of bribes. However, news of
                        accused citizens and officials within the geographic proximity increases their moral cost
                        against bribes and decreases the amount. This suggests that individually-tailored local
                        information on corruption may be an effective tool to reduce citizens' supply of bribes.

                            This study aims to provide empirical evidence on the economic and social impacts of access
                            to microloans disbursed through self-help group (SHG) programs. For this purpose, primary
                            data were collected from households in Kerala, South India, and combined with detailed
                            financial transactions of SHG members and information collected through laboratory
                            experiments. The estimation results show that wealthier group members are significantly more
                            likely to reap economic benefits, probably from productive investments. For poor members,
                            asset accumulation and consumption smoothing are the two main pathways out of poverty
                            through SHG-modeled microfinance initiatives. Finally, we find that reciprocal cooperation
                            and trust among group members are developed by repeated social interactions, which are
                            facilitated by weekly meetings of SHGs.

                            Political elites, who shape the fundamental pillars of the state, are becoming increasingly
                            divided. Some advocate democratic ideals and inclusive institutions, while others are
                            resolutely devoted to autocratic governance. What originates these fundamentally opposed
                            ideological commitments? This paper examines the long-term influence of early-life exposure
                            to the pro-democracy movement on shaping collective identity and fostering a commitment to
                            democratic governance among political elites. We focus on the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident in
                            Taiwan—a historic event in which peaceful demonstrations turned into violent suppression.
                            Using a triple-differences design combined with a Natural Language Processing approach, we
                            find that legislators who were in their formative years and born in Kaohsiung at the time of
                            the Incident more consistently suggest and support democracy-oriented legislation.
                            Furthermore, we develop a novel method of text-based identity detection and find that these
                            political elites internalize a Taiwanese national identity that is closely associated with
                            democratic values. Our findings suggest that localized movements and shared narratives can
                            foster a national identity that, in turn, reinforces ideological commitments, shaping
                            policymaking and helping societies uphold democratic norms.

                        Repression: Evidence From the Cultural Revolution in China</a>

                        <div class="pub-abstract">
                            Authoritarian governments have commonly adopted a patriotic education system during
                            political repression, aimed at legitimizing their authority and mitigating citizens' dissent
                            against political violence. We investigate the long-term impact of the patriotic educational
                            curriculum during the nationwide turmoil of the Cultural Revolution in China. Our analysis
                            leverages two concurrent natural experiments that occurred in the late Cultural Revolution:
                            (i) the sudden initiation of state-led violence against civilians and (ii) the educational
                            reform promoting patriotism in primary education. Employing a cohort
                            difference-in-differences design, we find that early-life exposure to such patriotic
                            indoctrination amidst state-led violence decreases the probability of having mental
                            illnesses in adulthood. The underlying mechanism suggests that patriotic education nurtures
                            political loyalty that legitimizes the authoritarian government and it reduces psychological
                            burdens caused by state-led violence. However, the post-Cultural Revolution regime reversed
                            the legitimacy of the Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution regime and implemented a new
                            educational curriculum. Our evidence shows that those who were exposed to conflicting
                            education programs are more likely to suffer from mental health problems. This highlights
                            that unsteady patriotic indoctrination due to unstable political regimes might deteriorate

                                            through social media affects societal discrimination and political

                                            developed and released an original mobile application in which social media
                                            news is
                                            delivered to users' mobile phones on the daily basis during the experimental
                                            period (202
                                            days). In this application, treatment and control arms are randomly
                                            built-in. In the
                                            treatment arm, a machine learning algorithm customizes news circulation
                                            based on individual
                                            user’s past behavior on the web. In the control arm, news circulation is
                                            fully randomized.
                                            Three main findings are obtained by econometric analyses. First, the
                                            customized news
                                            circulation significantly makes an individual flow of daily news more
                                            religiously biased and
                                            politically extreme. Second, users' political beliefs and preferences toward
                                            religious
                                            discrimination are unlikely to be affected by repeated exposure to such
                                            slant news. However,
                                            if users can recognize that a majority of other users express positive
                                            opinions on the slant
                                            news, they get to be less against religious discrimination and more strongly
                                            favor political
                                            extremism. Finally, the cognitive bias rather than concerns for social
                                            reputation is a main
                                            driver of emergence of societal discrimination and political polarization.

                                            This paper examines historical origins and persistence of parochial altruism
                                            by exploiting
                                            natural experiments during the early modern and the colonial period

                                            hostility can be nurtured by repeated exposure to intergroup conflicts among

                                            formation of fishing groups for each available fishing lot every year and
                                            intergroup
                                            conflicts had frequently occurred among these randomized fishing groups. All
                                            fishing groups
                                            are obligated to report any type of conflicts to religious judicial systems.
                                            I digitized
                                            detailed conflict information from 1801 to 1932 and combined it with the
                                            data from
                                            lab-in-the-field experiments for descendants. I find that an individual is
                                            more altruistic
                                            to other community members if their ancestors had more experiences of
                                            sharing a fishing
                                            group membership and more frequently sued other groups together (i.e., they
                                            shared common
                                            enemies). Furthermore, I demonstrate mechanisms through which such parochial
                                            altruism has
                                            persisted over generations.
