                        Indian Lower Judiciary</a>
                    <span class="pub-meta">Accepted, Journal of Development Economics</span>
                    <div class="pub-abstract">
                        Historically, the debate on judicial independence has been centered on whether the participation
                        of external branches in the appointment process of judges hampers the impartial administration
                        of justice. However, less attention has been given to how the internal judicial organization
                        shapes the judge's decision. This paper, which focuses on the Indian lower judiciary, explores
                        whether the prospects of promotion to higher courts result in currying favor with judicial
                        leaders who possess discretionary power over personnel matters within the judicial organization.
                        For this purpose, I exploit natural experiments: female judicial leader's appointments replacing
                        male incumbents, causing the unpredictable shift of gender preferences in personnel evaluation
                        of local judges. Then, I use the triple difference strategy exploiting the high-court level
                        variation on whether it has at least one female judicial leader, the individual judge level
                        variation on the eligibility as the high court judge, and the temporal variation pre- and
                        post-female judicial leader's appointment. Estimation results show that eligible judges pander
                        to female leaders and hand down lenient sentences on female parties. Evidence suggests that
                        discretionary appointments of judges through the non-transparent "judges-selecting-judges"
                        system can be detrimental to the independent administration of justice. Therefore, careful
                        institutional design is necessary to balance judicial accountability and independence.

                        Broad representation and competent leaders are both important factors when selecting
                        representatives in a democracy. While gender quotas aim for the equal representation of genders,
                        it is a challenge for non-elite women to become politicians in the context of elite dominance.
                        In such cases, equal representation between social classes may be impeded. Gender quotas may
                        also make the selection of competent leaders difficult if the number of qualified women is
                        limited and if the opportunity cost of becoming a politician is high for such women. This study
                        explores the random assignment of gender quotas across villages in India to examine the impact
                        of gender quotas on the broadness of representation and the competence of candidates. We
                        conducted a field survey in villages and collected information about cognitive and non-cognitive
                        related skills and the socioeconomic backgrounds of the voters and candidates in local
                        elections. We find that female candidates with higher cognitive skills are more positively
                        selected among voters compared to male candidates, while households with less leadership
                        experience can participate in elections as candidates in a gender quota system. These results
                        suggest that the quota system could have the potential to promote broad political participation
                        and encourage meritocratic candidate selection.

                        Since Hardin (1968) emphasized the fundamental difficulties of common pool resource (CPR)
                        management, social scientists have been struggling to find a way of mitigating a free-riding
                        problem in social dilemma situations. Empirical evidence based on a public goods experiment
                        demonstrates that introducing a punishment opportunity among subjects successfully solves the
                        free-riding problem. However, few studies investigate whether the effectiveness of such a
                        punishment option varies with community network structures. To examine this aspect, we targeted
                        10 Japanese fishing communities and conducted public goods games. During the course of the
                        experiments, we exogenously changed the rule of the game and introduced punishment
                        opportunities. Adopting the difference-in-differences strategy, we compare individual
                        contributions between closed and open community structures before and after the introduction of
                        the punishment opportunity. Estimation results find that the punishment option is
                        counterproductive in the closed communities because it crowds out existing cooperative norms.
                        This implies that policies without considering local community structures may exacerbate CPR
                        management problems.

                        Gender quotas are intended to address the underrepresentation of women in government. However,
                        their effectiveness is still debated. We explore the random assignment of gender quotas across
                        villages in India to investigate whether women members of local councils affect public good
                        allocation in their constituencies. We conducted a field survey in 100 villages with populations
                        of approximately 400 each, constituency size for which only one council member is elected for
                        representation. We find that the performance of women council members is generally the same as
                        men members in public good allocation, except for a lower performance by women in delivering
                        water facilities. We suggest that the influence of non-member actors such as husbands, lower
                        levels of educational achievement, and lower electoral incentive as obstacles that women members
                        face. We also find that the gender and castes of the council president affects the performance
                        of women council members.

                        While recent empirical evidence reveals some effective interventions in preventing corruption
                        among bureaucrats and politicians, there has been little discussion on how to prevent the
                        bribe-giving behavior of ordinary citizens. This paper investigates the role of social media
                        information in influencing the supply of bribes by citizens instead of the demand side. We
                        therefore developed and published an original news application in India and implemented a
                        three-month experiment. In this application, we randomly circulate live news related to
                        corruption to users and incorporate a lab experiment into the app system to elicit users'
                        bribery behavior every week. We find that corruption news involving politicians within a close
                        geographical proximity lowers users' moral costs against the anti-social bribery act, leading to
                        an increase in the amount of bribes. However, news of accused citizens and officials within the
                        geographic proximity increases their moral cost against bribes and decreases the amount. This
                        suggests that individually-tailored local information on corruption may be an effective tool to
                        reduce citizens' supply of bribes.

                        This study aims to provide empirical evidence on the economic and social impacts of access to
                        microloans disbursed through self-help group (SHG) programs. For this purpose, primary data were
                        collected from households in Kerala, South India, and combined with detailed financial
                        transactions of SHG members and information collected through laboratory experiments. The
                        estimation results show that wealthier group members are significantly more likely to reap
                        economic benefits, probably from productive investments. For poor members, asset accumulation
                        and consumption smoothing are the two main pathways out of poverty through SHG-modeled

                        Political Leaders: Evidence from the Pro-democracy Movement in Taiwan</a>

                        Political elites, who shape the fundamental pillars of the state, are becoming increasingly
                        divided. Some advocate democratic ideals and inclusive institutions, while others are resolutely
                        devoted to autocratic governance. What originates these fundamentally opposed ideological
                        commitments? This paper examines the long-term influence of early-life exposure to the
                        pro-democracy movement on shaping collective identity and fostering a commitment to democratic
                        governance among political elites. We focus on the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident in Taiwan—a historic
                        event in which peaceful demonstrations turned into violent suppression. Using a
                        triple-differences design combined with a Natural Language Processing approach, we find that
                        legislators who were in their formative years and born in Kaohsiung at the time of the Incident
                        more consistently suggest and support democracy-oriented legislation. Furthermore, we develop a
                        novel method of text-based identity detection and find that these political elites internalize a
                        Taiwanese national identity that is closely associated with democratic values. Our findings
                        suggest that localized movements and shared narratives can foster a national identity that, in
                        turn, reinforces ideological commitments, shaping policymaking and helping societies uphold
                        democratic norms.

                        Repression: Evidence From the Cultural Revolution in China</a>
                    <span class="pub-meta">(joint with Kai Kajitani)</span>
                    <div class="pub-abstract">
                        Authoritarian governments have commonly adopted a patriotic education system during political
                        repression, aimed at legitimizing their authority and mitigating citizens' dissent against
                        political violence. We investigate the long-term impact of the patriotic educational curriculum
                        during the nationwide turmoil of the Cultural Revolution in China. Our analysis leverages two
                        concurrent natural experiments that occurred in the late Cultural Revolution: (i) the sudden
                        initiation of state-led violence against civilians and (ii) the educational reform promoting
                        patriotism in primary education. Employing a cohort difference-in-differences design, we find
                        that early-life exposure to such patriotic indoctrination amidst state-led violence decreases
                        the probability of having mental illnesses in adulthood. The underlying mechanism suggests that
                        patriotic education nurtures political loyalty that legitimizes the authoritarian government and
                        it reduces psychological burdens caused by state-led violence. However, the post-Cultural
                        Revolution regime reversed the legitimacy of the Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution regime and
                        implemented a new educational curriculum. Our evidence shows that those who were exposed to
                        conflicting education programs are more likely to suffer from mental health problems. This
                        highlights that unsteady patriotic indoctrination due to unstable political regimes might
                        deteriorate the young generation's long-term mental health.

                        Toxicity in Online Communities</span>
                    <span class="pub-meta">(joint with Tsuyoshi Tsuru)</span>
                    <div class="pub-abstract">
                        Online toxicity has become a serious global concern, often intensified by platform features that
                        encourage social validation. This paper investigates how mutual rating systems—exemplified by
                        “like” buttons—cultivate approval-seeking behaviors that lead to increased toxicity. Leveraging
                        two natural experiments from a major Japanese Q&A platform—(i) the introduction of a like-button
                        feature and (ii) the subsequent integration of these ratings with monetary incentives—we use a
                        difference-in-differences approach combined with machine learning-based toxicity measures.
                        Intuitively, we compare how toxicity levels evolve before and after these interventions among
                        users who are particularly sensitive to social approval versus those who are not. Our findings
                        show that users driven by social approval become notably more toxic following these
                        interventions, indicating that public affirmation can exacerbate harmful behaviors. We attribute
                        this escalation to a phenomenon of “misperceived legitimization,” wherein approval-seeking
                        individuals initially conceal their propensity for harm but then interpret visible endorsements

                        commitment-saving (CS) products with either temporary savings subsidy with “premium”, or
                        prevailing “market” interest rate. Premium group doubles the formal savings, resulted in
                        increased food and non-food expenditure by 8.6-12.6% during the lean season, with no lasting

                        Social preferences shape behavioral principles in various aspects of society. Therefore, it is
                        important to understand the determinants of social preferences to ensure the overall efficacy of
                        any organizations. However, little is known about how repeated daily interactions foster social
                        preferences. This study investigates whether social interactions in the workplace affect the
                        conformity of social preferences among workers, and whether social coherence underlies the
                        development of fairness norms in organizations. A two-week field experiment was conducted with
                        agricultural manual laborers in the Philippines, where team compositions and payment contracts
                        were randomized. Additionally, lab-in-the-field experiments were conducted to measure social
                        preferences. The results show that workers who belonged to the same group more frequently during
                        the experiment have similar social preferences compared to those who did not belong to the same
                        group. Moreover, workers who worked together are more likely to comply with the fifty-fifty norm
                        in the dictator game than those who did not. Finally, we find that group-based financial
                        incentives improve social preference conformity and the emergence of the fairness norm. These
                        findings suggest that social interactions and incentive schemes play an important role in
                        influencing an organization's performance by shaping their social preferences and norms.

                        This paper investigates whether exposure to the extreme views of vocal minorities on social
                        media undermines a pro-social consensus in society, focusing on corruption in India. We
                        developed an original mobile application to randomly distribute news and blogs about corruption
                        to users and quantify their attitudes toward corruption by applying machine learning algorithms
                        to the opinions posted on our app. By comparing users' attitudes before and after viewing
                        extreme articles, our estimation results show that users become more radical in reinforcing
                        their original attitudes after viewing extreme content. Vocal minorities erode the pro-social
                        consensus against corruption by causing polarization. The underlying mechanisms suggest that
                        pro-attitudinal extreme information shifts users' recognition of group norms in a more extreme
                        direction and induces users' conformity to updated group norms. In contrast, counter-attitudinal
                        extreme information causes an emotional backlash against dissenting communities. However, this
                        radicalization effect completely dissipates within a week once the distribution of online
                        information is terminated within our app, implying that polarization in online society will not
                        persist for a long time if repeated exposure to vocal minority extremism is mitigated.

                    <div class="pub-abstract">
                        This paper provides field-experimental evidence on how repeated exposure to biased news through
                        social media affects societal discrimination and political polarization in India. I developed
                        and released an original mobile application in which social media news is delivered to users'
                        mobile phones on the daily basis during the experimental period (202 days). In this application,
                        treatment and control arms are randomly built-in. In the treatment arm, a machine learning
                        algorithm customizes news circulation based on individual user’s past behavior on the web. In
                        the control arm, news circulation is fully randomized. Three main findings are obtained by
                        econometric analyses. First, the customized news circulation significantly makes an individual
                        flow of daily news more religiously biased and politically extreme. Second, users' political
                        beliefs and preferences toward religious discrimination are unlikely to be affected by repeated
                        exposure to such slant news. However, if users can recognize that a majority of other users
                        express positive opinions on the slant news, they get to be less against religious
                        discrimination and more strongly favor political extremism. Finally, the cognitive bias rather
                        than concerns for social reputation is a main driver of emergence of societal discrimination and
                        political polarization.

                    <div class="pub-abstract">
                        This paper examines historical origins and persistence of parochial altruism by exploiting
                        natural experiments during the early modern and the colonial period (1801-1932) of South India.
                        Theory suggests that parochial altruism composed of in-group favoritism and out-group hostility
                        can be nurtured by repeated exposure to intergroup conflicts among socially-defined groups.
                        Natural experiments in South India provides the suitable setting to test this theory: some
                        communities in this region had historically adopted a randomized formation of fishing groups for
                        each available fishing lot every year and intergroup conflicts had frequently occurred among
                        these randomized fishing groups. All fishing groups are obligated to report any type of
                        conflicts to religious judicial systems. I digitized detailed conflict information from 1801 to
                        1932 and combined it with the data from lab-in-the-field experiments for descendants. I find
                        that an individual is more altruistic to other community members if their ancestors had more
                        experiences of sharing a fishing group membership and more frequently sued other groups together
                        (i.e., they shared common enemies). Furthermore, I demonstrate mechanisms through which such
                        parochial altruism has persisted over generations.
